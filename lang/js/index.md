---

These rules extend and override the [general rules][general-rules].

If you are writing Angular code, please refer the [Angular](angular) rules under JS.


Tooling
-------

Use a lint checker.  We recommend [ESLint].  We also have a custom [.eslintrc.yaml](eslintrc.yaml) and [.eslintignore](eslintignore.txt) for general purpose JavaScript utilizing ES6.  When writing code for Angular, you may prefer this [.eslintrc.yaml](eslintrc-angular.yaml) for Angular.  The rules are quite strict intentionally.  We aim to catch as many problems as possible early in the development lifecycle.


Files and Directories
---------------------

Tests for `*.js` files are named `*.spec.js`.  It is preferred that tests live within a `spec/` folder in a path that otherwise matches the original filename.  For instance, when testing `lib/manager/abc-manager.js`, the test filename will be `spec/lib/manager/abc-manager.spec.js`.  Sometimes, such as with Angular code, tests live alongside the libraries.

Angular directives, services, etc. have their type after the name (eg `some-directive-service.js` and `datepicker-directive.js`).  Angular code, in general, will be within folders for each module.

Files closely associated with each other should be named similarly.  This way you can see that the files `response-template-service.js`, `response-template-service.css` and `response-template-service-declined.html` are all related.

See [a suggested app structure here](suggested-app-structure.md).


Variables, Naming and Capitalization
------------------------------------

Do not use global variables.

There shall be a single `var` line per function.  Optionally, there may be a `var` line near the top of a file for module-constrained "global" variables.  There will be a single `const` declaration for constants used in a module.

Variables, methods and property names will use `camelCase` style formatting.  Only constructors will use a leading capital letter, such as `Date` and `EventEmitter`.  Underscores are prohibited.

Functions are named only if they are not supposed to be overridden.  Anonymous functions do not need a name and shouldn't get one and should either be passed directly or assigned to a variable.

When declaring multiple variables, they should be declared alphabetically and any symbols at the front of variable names should come before ones without. This is enforced with the ESLint configuration we use. Where there is a conflict between two matching variable names, capitalized variable names should be listed first; think carefully before you name two variables similarly because that typically indicates a problem.

It is typical, when using jQuery, to name your jQuery-ized variables with a `$` in front, like `$elements = $('input');`.


    // Alphabetically Correct
    function someFunction () {
        var $car, bus, Car, car;

        // Work here
    }


Comments
--------

Comment any tricky bits of code or rewrite them entirely to be less tricky.

Use `//` style comments for single lines and `/* comment */` style for multiple lines.  For multiple line comments, there should be a column of asterisks that line up.  The comment must be placed before the code in question.

    // This bit is tricky - we don't call the function
    if (foobar) {
        /* A bigger comment goes here for an example.
         * We're calling foobar in a special way.
         */
        foobar.call(foobar);
    }

Use `/* eslint some-feature:"off" */` style comments for eslint flags.  Disable the check for as few lines of code as possible.

Use `/* global someThing */` style after the file's JSDoc header for defining global variables for eslint.  However, this should not be necessary because we should be using factory methods and injecting dependencies.  A notable exception is when working with JavaScript that operates in a browser and 3rd party libraries are exposed only through global variables.

Comments wrap at 80 characters unless there's a compelling reason not to do this, such as when using a very long URL or embedding a code example.

Never leave code that is commented out.  It should be removed.  If we need it back, the code should all be documented through [git][topic-git].


JSDoc Comments
--------------

JSDoc is required before every function and at the top of a file in order to explain the purpose and usage.

JSDoc comments start with `/**` on a line by itself.  The first line should be a single-line quick description and is followed by an empty line.  After that is an optional description and [Markdown][lang-md] is encouraged.  A newline separates description from parameters or other annotations.  Use `@param` and `@return` instead of the aliases.  When documenting a `Promise`, indicate the value that will be provided if the promise is resolve.

`Number` and `number` are two different things.  The former is an object and the latter is a basic data type.  It's more prominent if you are using `String` vs `string` or `Boolean` vs `boolean`. One must always use `Array` (or the `xxxx[]` shorthand) because there's no `array` primitive.


Indentation and Whitespace
--------------------------

The [general rules][general-rules] has most of these rules.

Opening braces and brackets are attached to the code on the left.  Indentation always increases with braces and arrays.  Spaces before and after most operators.  Blank line above comments, two blank lines above JSDoc comments.  No whitespace required at the very beginning nor end of a block of code.  Newlines after commas in a list of constants, array literals and object literals.  No space between a function name and its arguments.  Include a space after operators.

ESLint forces `case` statements and the `default` case in switches to be un-indented (just that line).  There must be a blank line after `break;` as well.

In general, chained function calls should be on a single line. This intentionally looks ugly so you write code that's more debuggable. Rare exceptions can be made for certain libraries that were designed specifically to be used by chaining many function calls together.

Property names shall be followed immediately by a colon, a space, and the property's value.

We encourage limiting instances of newlines to the cases enumerated in this guide but it is not compulsory. We recommend newlines are used in a consistent and logical manner.


ES6, ES5
--------

No trailing comma after the last property of an object or the last element in an array.

We typically code for ECMA Script 6.  Notable exceptions include libraries that could be used in browsers or Angular code.  In those cases we conform to ES5 entirely; the tests may run in an ES6 environment but the entire repository should use ES5 style for consistency.

JavaScript that is expected to work outside of Angular is written using a module loading syntax.  Angular-specific code already uses a module syntax.  For module loading we suggest [Dizzy] or [ModuleJS].  If this is going to work in a browser, you should check out [Fid-UMD] to package source files in a module-system-agnostic method.

When writing ES6, use arrow functions for anonymous function unless you must use a different context (the `this` variable) or if you want to access the magic `arguments` variable.

We like parenthesis and braces.  All control structures, like `if` statements, require braces.  ES6 arrow functions should use parenthesis, braces and `return`.


Specific Constructs
-------------------

Property names should be unquoted unless it is necessary to wrap them in quotes.

Nothing that's displayable to the user should be sourced from JavaScript.  The wording should come from an HTML template, a JSON file from a server or API calls.  Provide codes, not text strings.

Use double-quoted strings.

Avoid manual minification - let a minifier do it.  Ternary statements should be expanded into `if` blocks.  Even though `!!~haystack.indexOf(needle)` is tricky and neat, write `haystack.indexOf(needle) !== -1` so all programmers on the project immediatly know what the code does.

Typecasting can use a little bit of shorthand.  `+num` to cast to a number or `NaN`, `+num || 0` to cast to a number (`NaN` becomes 0), `!!bool` to cast to a boolean, `[].concat(arrayVar)` to cast to an Array.

Because JavaScript is loosely typed, `5 == "5"` is true.  If you need to care about data types, you can compare them with `5 === "5"`.  This matters a lot for falsy values such as `null`, `undefined`, false, 0, and "".

* `null` is an empty value and it's a "known" empty value.  Not an error.
* `undefined` is an empty value that usually signifies a missing return value, parameter or unsent data.  If we assign it to something it should be considered some sort of error.
* `false` is a boolean indicating something is off.
* `0` is the number zero.
* `""` is an empty string.

To compare these things we typically will use `if (!variable)` instead of `if (variable === false)`.  When we must care about datatypes, we are (thankfully) forced by ESLint to use `===` and `!==`.  Be wary of `switch` because its comparison is **not** loosely typed.

For easier testing and much more sanity, follow a dependency injection pattern and have all of the library files export a function, then call the function to pass in dependencies.  [Dizzy] can automate this, such as with the [OpenToken] repository, though you can just do the dependency injection yourself like [Restify Router Magic].

Always use semicolons.  ESLint helps find mistakes where they were omitted.

Prefer duck typing in library functions unless you truly care about using specific types of instances.  In tests, it is often simpler to perform instance checking.

Instead of using `.catch()` for promises, prefer using the second parameter in the `.then()` block for rejection handling.


Ordering
--------

File contents are ordered according to the type of content that is within the file.  Classes are also ordered and functions have their own special notes as well.


### Modules (Collection of Functions)

    /**
     * This file is an example module.
     */
    "use strict";


    /**
     * Change a string into uppercase.
     *
     * @param {string} input
     * @return {string}
     */
    function upper(input) {
        return input.toUpperCase();
    }


    module.exports = upper;

1.  JSDoc comment explaining the scope of the code.
2.  Enable strict mode with `"use strict";`
3.  Functions that should be used throughout.
4.  Class declaration, if needed.
5.  Assign the class, function, or object to `module.exports`.


### Modules (Factory Function)

When using a factory, the order is the same, however the factory function typically contains all of the necessary functions.

    /**
     * This file is an example that exports a logger factory.
     *
     * The factory pattern helps us avoid using global variables.
     */
    "use strict";

    /**
     * Creates the logger.
     *
     * @param {node~console} console
     * @return {logger~instance}
     */
    module.exports = () => {
        /**
         * Logs an informational message to the console.
         *
         * @param {*} ...args
         */
        function info() {
            var args;

            args = [].slice.call(arguments);
            args.unshift("INFO:");
            console.log.apply(console, args);
        }


        /**
         * @typedef {Object} logger~instance
         * @property {Function} info
         */
        return {
            info
        }
    }


### Library for Multiple Module Systems

If your code is intended to be consumed as a library, the order is similar.

    // fid-umd {"name":"SampleModule"}
    (function (name, root, factory) {
        function isObject(x) { return typeof x === "object"; }
        if (isObject(root.module) && isObject(root.module.exports)) {
            root.module.exports = factory();
        } else if (isObject(root.exports)) {
            root.exports[name] = factory();
        } else if (isObject(root.define) && root.define.amd) {
            root.define(name, [], factory);
        } else if (isObject(root.modulejs)) {
            root.modulejs.define(name, factory);
        } else if (isObject(root.YUI)) {
            root.YUI.add(name, function (Y) { Y[name] = factory(); });
        } else {
            root[name] = factory();
        }
    }("SampleModule", this, function () {
        // fid-umd end

        "use strict;"

        // Do stuff here

        return theContentWeWantToExport;

        // fid-umd post
    }));
    // fid-umd post-end

1.  JSDoc comment explaining the scope of the code.
2.  [Fid-UMD] markup and wrapping code.
2.  Enable strict mode with `"use strict";`
3.  Functions that should be used throughout.
4.  Class declaration.
5.  Return the desired value.
6.  [Fid-UMD] ending wrapping code.


### Class Bodies

A class body is also ordered.

    /**
     * A trivial counter example.
     */
    class MyClass {
        /**
         * Creates the object.
         */
        constructor() {
            this.value = 0;
        }

        /**
         * Increments the value by an optional amount.
         *
         * @param {number} [amount=1]
         */
        increment(amount) {
            if (typeof amount === "undefined") {
                amount = 1;
            }

            // Careful.  This typecasts intentionally.
            this.value += +amount;
        }

        /**
         * Logs the current value.
         */
        log() {
            console.log(this.value);
        }
    }

1.  JSDoc comment explaining the class.
2.  Class declaration.
3.  Constructor (if any).
4.  Alphabetical listing of methods.
5.  Assign the object to `module.exports`.


### Function Bodies

Function bodies also have a specific order.  This helps to mentally arrange items to match the hoisting that the interpreter uses.

    /**
     * Example function that iterates through an array.
     *
     * @param {Array.<string>} stringList
     * @return {number} Total number of characters.
     */
    function showStrings(stringList) {
        var characterCount;

        /**
         * Writes a single item to the console.  Adds the number of
         * letters to characterCount.
         *
         * @param {string} str
         */
        function processEntry(str) {
            characterCount += str.length;
            console.log(str);
        }

        stringList.forEach(processEntry);

        return characterCount;
    }

1.  JSDoc comment explaining the function.
2.  Function declaration.
3.  Variable declaration.  One line only, alphabetical variables, no assignments.
4.  Functions, sorted alphabetically when possible.
5.  The code that executes.


Testing
-------

You can and should achieve 100% test coverage and examine all branches.  It's far easier when you use a factory pattern for your libraries.

We wish to perform behavioral testing.  Test every intended way we will be using objects and all exposed functions.

All tests should pass before merging code to a parent branch.

Test names should be grammatically correct and read like a sentence.  The descriptions should describe the observable behavior, not what is going on in the code.


Example
-------

This example is quite long and includes many comments to help illustrate the rules.

    /**
     * This is a JSDoc formatted comment that describes the file.  Not much is
     * expected here as far as annotations.  The lines all fit within 80
     * characters and the asterisks on the left all line up.  Markdown is
     * expected to be used for code examples, but that's pretty easy.  Just
     * indent some code with four spaces and keep it a line away from text.
     *
     *     // Sample usage
     *     var test;
     *     test = new FakeTestClass();
     *     test.run('something');
     *
     * This next "global" part flags `window` as a global variable.  This
     * module will get `window` passed in as the `wind` parameter.  Nothing
     * in this function accesses any globals.
     */
    /*global window*/
    (function (global, wind) {
        /**
         * This is a fake class for illustration purposes.
         *
         * The class gets a capital letter at the beginning because it is a
         * constructor.
         *
         * @class FakeTestClass
         */
        class FakeTestClass {
            /**
             * Instantiates the object.  Assigns the call count property.
             * No arguments and no return code, so those JSDoc tags are not used.
             */
            constructor() {
                this.callCount = 0;
            },


            /**
             * Sample event handler
             *
             * @param {Event} event Unused in this example
             * @param {AnotherClass~speciallyFormattedObject} data Checks for callCount
             */
            onClick(event, data) {
                var lastClickData;


                /**
                 * Copy a property from incoming data into the lastClickData
                 *
                 * This is a function, thus it's split out here and documented.
                 * In lieu of this separate function, an ES6 arrow function
                 * could have been used inside the `.forEach()`.
                 *
                 * @param {string} name
                 */
                function copyProperty(name) {
                    if (data[name]) {
                        lastClickData[name] = data[name];
                    }
                }


                if (typeof data === "object" && data.callCount) {
                    this.callCount = +data.callCount || 0;
                }

                lastClickData = {};

                /* Normally `copyProperty` would be an inline arrow function.
                 * It is a standalone function here for illustrative purposes.
                 */
                [
                    'mouseX',
                    'mouseY'
                ].forEach(copyProperty);

                this.lastClickData = lastClickData;
            },
